# GymBuddy

This project was made for University of Turku course named Project I.

GumBuddy is a web project that I made to practice my skills in fullstack development. It is an app to log your reps, sets and weights during gym training. User has some default programs to choose from as well as the option to create his/her own programs. All logs can be viewed in the history-page.

Frontend is published in [Netlify](https://gymbuddysite.netlify.app/).

## Frontend

Frontend has been created with React. API calls to the backend are done with Axios.

## Backend

Backend is developed on NodeJS and more precisely, Express.js. The API makes calls to a MongoDB database.

## Problems and missing implementation

There is no login option, so every user is changing the same instance for now.
